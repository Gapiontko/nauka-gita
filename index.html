			<h1>Liberty</h1>
			<p>Do you know how it tastes to be free<br>
			What's the meaning of liberty<br>
			Do you know how it feels when it's lost<br>
			Living in slavery</p>
			<p>They want to tell you<br>
			What's right and what's wrong<br>
			And then force you to crawl<br>
			And if you let them<br>
			You're lost and you're wasted<br>
			Forever and ever you're done</p>
			<p>Looking back I can see those mistakes<br>
			I can see the points we failed<br>
			Can we change frankly it seems to me<br>
			Now the power is all theirs</p>
			<p>They want to tell you<br>
			What's right and what's wrong<br>
			And then force you to crawl<br>
			And if you let them<br>
			You're lost and you're wasted<br>
			Forever and ever you're done</p>
			<p>And when we wake<br>
			It'll be too late<br>
			flame has already stopped burning<br>
			And when we wake<br>
			Then we will see<br>
			At this point there is no returning</p>
